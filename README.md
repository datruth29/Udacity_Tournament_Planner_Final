Tournament Planner
==================

My implementation of the Tournament Planner for the final project of Udacity's [Intro to Relational Databases class](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197).

I implemented some of the extra credit work, specifically:
- Support for multiple tournaments
- Can handle draws

What still needs to be done:
- Handles tournaments with an odd number of players
- Rank players by strength of previous opponents
- Prevent rematches between players
- Do pairings based on points instead of wins
- Implement byes Can handle draws
